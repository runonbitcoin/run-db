Crawls the blockchain and indexes RUN state.

Using Run-DB, you can self-host the State APIs that Run uses to work well.

Use Run-DB to:

- Operate a State Server to improve RUN performance by pre-loading jigs
- Query balances, volume, history, and other information across many users and contracts
- Blacklist individual transactions and their descendants in your app
- Create your own local database of transactions your app uses

## Requirements

Node 10+

## Getting started

1. Install `npm run install`
2. Download a db snapshot: `wget https://run.network/run-db-snapshots/main/latest -O run.db` (*optional*)
3. Run `npm run start`
4. Install a
   trustlist: `curl -s https://api.run.network/v1/main/trust | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @- http://localhost:8000/trust` (*
   optional*)

**Note**: For testnet, you may use `test` in place of `main` in the above commands.

## Use with your App Server

Setup your server's `Run` instance as follows:

```javascript
const client = true
const state = new Run.plugins.RunDB('http://localhost:8000')
const trust = ['state']
const run = new Run({ client, state, trust })
```

Client mode makes Run-DB the source of truth for your server for all jig information. RUN will not load jigs that are
not in your database, and your inventory will only be populated by jig UTXOs known to your database.

Setting trust to `'state'` makes Run use your database for its trustlist too. This means you only have to setup trust in
one place using:

```
curl -X POST localhost:8000/trust/<txid>
```

You may also want to run additional instance of Run-DB in `SERVE_ONLY` mode. That allows you to have an writer that
crawls transactions and puts data into the database, and multiple readers that serve your application servers.

## Use with a Browser or Mobile Client

The same approach taken for servers can be used to improve performance of client `Run` instances. You should expose your
Run-DB endpoints on a public or private domain rather than connect to `localhost`. If your client connections are not
authenticated, be sure to only expose the GET endpoints and never the POST or DELETE endpoints, and use HTTPS to prevent
MITM attacks.

## Blob storage

Run-db needs to handle multiple kinds of raw data in order to work. There is 2 ways to manage that data at the moment:

- Save them inside the main db.
- Save them externally using a data api.

The blob storage implementation can be configured using env variables.

## Use execution server

Run-db allows to separate the execution of run transactions into different machines. The way to do that is trough
execution servers. The execution server is a standalone process used to execute run transactions. The main process
communicates with the execution server using http.

In order to run the execution server it's required to use an external blob storage.

## Configuration

Create a .env file or set the following environment variables before running to configure the DB.

### Connecting with a bitcoin node

During development is useful to connect to a local node. In order to do this you need to provide RUN-db with access to a
bitcoin node trough RPC and ZMQ.

```
export API="bitcoin-node"
export ZMQ_URL="tcp://your-node-uri:port"
export RPC_URL="http://user:password@your-node-uri:port"
```

The only zmq message is needed is `rawtx`. ZMQ is only used to get the new transactions in the mempool.

Direct connection with the node is tested in regtest and testnet, but it's not recommeded for production environments in
mainnet at the moment.

## Endpoints

* `GET /jig/:location` - Gets the state for a jig at a particular location
* `GET /berry/:location` - Gets the state for a berry at a particular location
* `GET /tx/:txid` - Gets the raw transaction hex for an added transaction
* `GET /time/:txid` - Gets the block or mempool time of a transaction in seconds since unix epoch
* `GET /spends/:location` - Gets the spending txid for an output at a particular location
* `GET /unspent` - Gets the locations of all unspent jigs that are trusted. You may optionally pass in the following
  query params: `class` to filter by contract origin, `address` to filter by owner address, `pubkey` to filter by owner
  pubkey, `scripthash` to filter by hash of the owner script, `lock` to filter by lock class origin.
* `GET /trust/:txid?` - Gets whether a particular txid is trusted, or the entire trust list
* `GET /ban/:txid?` - Gets whether a particular txid is banned, or the entire ban list
* `GET /status` - Prints status information

* `POST /trust/:txid?` - Trusts a transaction to execute its code, as well as any untrusted ancestors. To trust multiple
  transactions at once, you may add an array of txids in the body as application/json.
* `POST /ban/:txid` - Bans a transaction from being executed, and unindexes it and its descendents
* `POST /tx/:txid?` - Indexes a transaction and any ancestors. You may optionally add the raw hex data for the
  transaction in the body as text/plain.

* `DELETE /trust/:txid` - Removes trust for a transaction, and unindexes it and its descendents
* `DELETE /ban/:txid` - Removes a transaction ban, and reindexes it and its descendents
* `DELETE /tx/:txid` - Removes a transaction, its descendents, and any connected state

## Performing Custom Queries

Run-DB uses SQLite as its underlying database in [WAL](https://sqlite.org/wal.html) mode. SQLite and WAL allows multiple
connections to the database so long as there is only one writer, which should be Run-DB. Alternatively, forking Run-DB
to create new endpoints for your application may be simpler.

### Example Queries

For some of these queries, you will need the [JSON1](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html) SQLite extension.

#### Calculate SHUA supply

```
SELECT SUM(amount) as supply
FROM (
    SELECT
        json_extract(jig.state, '$.props.amount') AS amount
    FROM jig JOIN spends ON jig.location = spends.location
    WHERE spends.spend_txid IS NULL
    AND jig.class = 'ce8629aa37a1777d6aa64d0d33cd739fd4e231dc85cfe2f9368473ab09078b78_o1')
```

#### Calculate SHUA token balances by owner

```
SELECT owner, SUM(amount) as amount
FROM (SELECT
        json_extract(jig.state, '$.props.owner') AS owner,
        json_extract(jig.state, '$.props.amount') AS amount
    FROM jig JOIN spends ON jig.location = spends.location
    WHERE spends.spend_txid IS NULL
    AND jig.class = 'ce8629aa37a1777d6aa64d0d33cd739fd4e231dc85cfe2f9368473ab09078b78_o1')
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY amount DESC
```

#### Get transaction hex

```
SELECT HEX(bytes) AS hex
FROM tx
WERE txid = 'ce8629aa37a1777d6aa64d0d33cd739fd4e231dc85cfe2f9368473ab09078b78'
```

#### Re-execute all transactions

```
UPDATE tx SET executed = 0; DELETE FROM jig; DELETE FROM berry;
```
